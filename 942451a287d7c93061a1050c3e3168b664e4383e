      "message": "Maybe, if you use cy.get(\u0027body\u0027).click(...) here, it would make Jenkins happy.\nEarlier, I experienced an issue with using absolute position with the #document-container item. If #document-container is not at the (0,0) position, then the absolute position does not point to the right coordinate. Using \u0027body\u0027 might solve this or adjusting the coordinates with the #document-container\u0027s position.",

      "message": "Will try, thanks!\n\nThe odd thing is that this is the coordinate that works above. We are only clicking at the same place for a second time to re-enter edit-mode. So I guess either the document-container has moved, or something else is wrong (f.e. we don\u0027t get the right notifications from Core in time). Of course this passes locally without exception (100% of the time)! So I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s different on the CI job.",
