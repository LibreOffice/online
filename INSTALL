We strongly discourage to build both core and online as superuser.
Therefore, make sure you have a non-privileged user which can
run /sbin/setcap with sudo without password.
Make even sure that the user you're going to use owns the whole tree
(the simplest way is to directly clone with the user user for build).

To build LibreOffice Online you'll need to compile LibreOffice core first:
1. Clone core repository
   git clone https://git.libreoffice.org/core
2. ./autogen.sh --with-distro=LibreOfficeOnline
3. make


When you have a working build of LOKit you can build LOOL.

1. Clone this repository
   git clone https://git.libreoffice.org/online
2. ./autogen.sh
3. ./configure --prefix=/usr \
               --sysconfdir=/etc \
               --localstatedir=/var \
               --enable-silent-rules \
               --with-lokit-path=YOUR_INCLUDE_PATH_TO_CORE_BUILD \
               --with-lo-path=/opt/libreoffice
4. make


If you're interested in building a docker image, refer to the
`docker` directory and to https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/BuildingOnline
