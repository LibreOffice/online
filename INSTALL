To build LibreOffice Online you'll need to compile LibreOffice core first:
1. Clone core repository
   git clone https://git.libreoffice.org/core
2. ./autogen.sh --with-distro=LibreOfficeOnline
3. make

After that you can compile the online part. Make sure you have
an user called `lool` which can run /sbin/setcap with sudo
without password. Make even sure the lool user owns all
the directories used to build.

1. Clone this repository
   git clone https://git.libreoffice.org/online
2. ./autogen.sh
3. ./configure --prefix=/usr \
               --sysconfdir=/etc \
               --localstatedir=/var \
               --enable-silent-rules \
               --with-lokit-path=YOUR_INCLUDE_PATH_TO_CORE_BUILD \
               --with-lo-path=/opt/libreoffice
4. make
