      "message": "Why remove the include of DocumentBroker.hpp (and use a forward declaration instead)? In LibreOffice forward declarations are used a lot, to reduce compilation time, but there the code-base is *much* larger. No need to try to reduce compilation time here.\n\nIf there is some other reason why DocumentBroker.hpp can not be included, fix that. I think it is best to avoid forward declarations, they are a bit ugly. Matter of taste, sure.",
