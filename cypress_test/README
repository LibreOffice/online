Cypress based test framework for LibreOffice Online
====================================================

Running tests
------------------

All tests are part of the make check build. So you can
just execute it from the root folder or under the
cypress_test folder to run cypress tests only.

    make check

To run cypress test cases selectively, you need to
go in to the cypress_test folder first and run one of
the following commands.

To run all desktop tests:

    make check-desktop

To run all mobile tests:

    make check-mobile

To run one specific test suit of desktop tests:

    make check-desktop spec=example_desktop_test_spec.js

To run one specific test suit of mobile tests:

    make check-mobile spec=toolbar_spec.js

You can also open cypress tests in the browser, so you can
check what happens during test run. It's useful for writing
new tests or checking why an existing test fails.

To open desktop tests in browser:

    make run-desktop

To open mobile tests in browser:

    make run-mobile

During the build we run the tests with Chrome browser, so make sure
you select Chrome browser on the GUI while checking tests.
