Cypress based test framework for LibreOffice Online
====================================================


Installation
------------------

In a normal desktop environment you only need to install npm
packages for running cypress tests. This is done by the build
system, so running 'make check' will do the basic installation.
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#npm-install

For CI you might need to install some additional dependencies:
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/continuous-integration.html#Dependencies


Running tests
------------------

All tests are part of the make check build. So you can
just execute it from the root folder or under the
cypress_test folder to run cypress tests only.

    make check

To run cypress test cases selectively, you need to
go in to the cypress_test folder first and run one of
the following commands.

To run all desktop tests:

    make check-desktop

To run all mobile tests:

    make check-mobile

To run one specific test suit of desktop tests,
use spec argument with a relative path to
cypress_test/data/desktop/:

    make check-desktop spec=example_desktop_test_spec.js

To run one specific test suit of mobile tests,
use spec argument with a relative path to
cypress_test/data/mobile/:

    make check-mobile spec=writer/toolbar_spec.js


Running one specific test
------------------

To run one test case of a test suit you can use Mocha's
'only' feature. Just replace the it(...) function with
it.only(...) in the spec file for the selected test case
and run the test suit using the spec parameter.

For example, to run the test with title 'Apply font name.'
inside apply_font_spec.js file, you need to add it.only():

-    it('Apply font name.', function() {
+    it.only('Apply font name.', function() {

Then run the test suit with:

    make check-mobile spec=writer/apply_font_spec.js

Or open the file in the interactive test runner.

    make run-mobile


Openning interactive test runner
----------------------------------

Cypress has an interactive test runner application which
runs the test in the browser. So you can see the result of
the different steps your test makes in the browser. It's useful
during writing new tests or checking why an existing
test fails.
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html

To open desktop tests in the test runner:

    make run-desktop

To open mobile tests in the test runner:

    make run-mobile

During the build we run the tests with Chrome browser, so make sure
you select Chrome browser on the GUI while checking tests.
We are using different configuration and environment variables for
mobile and desktop tests, that's why there are two separate commands
for them and there is no option to open all the tests in the
test runner.
