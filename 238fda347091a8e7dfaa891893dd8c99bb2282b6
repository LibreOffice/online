      "message": "Again, why return shared_ptr here at all when you can do with a std::string ?\n\nIf you have some solid reason, we can keep it here like this but otherwise it looks absolutely superfluous to me. If you are worried about std::string being copied, an optimizing compiler should already take care of that and RVO[1] would kick in.",

I read on stacktrace something related to DocumentBroker so I believe there is an issue with its disposing. I will send you stacktrace and log file via email.",
