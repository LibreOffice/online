      "message": "So - this code appears to be copy/pasted from above.\nCopy/paste coding is a deadly serious sign of appalling programming.\nThat has to be fixed and as much as possible of this shared before we push this \u003d)\nJust split out the functionality to be a method on the tabs object itself that we can invoke via a small stub here. I would prefer that even for small things like \u0027insertsheetafter\u0027\n\nIn addition copy/pasting translatable strings is also sub-optimal; so if we can take the original data structure from the non-mobile thing; and have a local method:\n\nthis.insertContextMenu() - that backends onto L.insertContextMenu() - and/or programatically re-writes the context menu to use JSDialog that would be awesome (and really useful to re-use elsewhere).\n\nCan you look into that ?",
