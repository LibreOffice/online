So, we can get rid of this line and instead mention the interactive flag when we create the ruler.\n\nOther than that, I wonder what happens if we get to know that the document is not-editable *after* we create the ruler in edit mode. I mean, the perm: message received from the backend says that the document is readonly *after* the ruler has been created. In that case we will still have ruler interactions.",
