		<h2>Clean look, feature rich Side Bar, and much more</h2>
<p><strong>Cambridge, United Kingdom, December 16, 2019</strong> – <strong>Collabora Productivity</strong>, the driving force behind bringing LibreOffice to the cloud, is excited to announce a new, major release of our product <strong>CODE (Collabora Online Development Edition) 4.2.0</strong>
 This release includes a fresh look, mobile improvements, improved 
inter-operability, new dialogs and functionality as well as a raft of 
bug fixes and polish. The release gives you an insight into our 
soon-to-be released enterprise version <a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/">Collabora Online 4.2.0</a>.
 CODE and Collabora Online offer privacy as well as the only truly 
open-source solution for working with and collaborating on rich 
documents in the cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CODE.svg"><img role="img" src="latest-updates_files/CODE.svg" alt="CODE logo" moz-reader-center="true" width="1024" height="1024"></a></p>
<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<p>This major update of Collabora Online Development Edition (CODE) 
comes with a rich new user interface and is built onto of the stability 
and performance of our LTS version of LibreOffice: Collabora Office 6.2.
 It includes many improvements in functionality and user-friendliness. 
The most obvious new feature is the powerful sidebar on the right. Many 
settings for text and all kind of properties of objects in the documents
 can be easily updated here. The sidebar makes it much easier to change 
tables, colour settings and charts elements in the browser, with close 
to the same feature richness that is available in Collabora Office on 
the desktop. The status bar has been redesigned and our powerful 
function wizard is now available in Calc online. Copy and paste of rich 
text and content is added for online, and our responsive user interface 
adapts nicely to mobile phones and tablets.</p>
<h2>Rich chart functions from the side bar</h2>
<p>When charts are selected, the sidebar now gives access to a wide 
range of features. For example, you can easily choose chart types from 
bars, lines and points, pies and more, or whether the diagram should be 
displayed in 3D.</p>
<p>Other elements of charts can now also be adjusted from the sidebar. 
You can now determine how and where titles and legends are displayed. 
Furthermore, many of the visual elements of the diagram can be adjusted 
here. The sidebar also allows you to define the surface colour, 
transparency, line types and grid lines.</p>

<p><i>Click to see that in action</i>:</p>

<h2>Online function wizard: a powerful tool for formulas</h2>
<p>Working with formulas is important and especially for the more 
complex types, having help with the tenth optional parameter is good. 
The function wizard does that and from now on is available in Calc 
online. The function wizard grants easy access to all elements of also 
the most complex formulas. It shows the structure and meaning of 
different parts of a formula, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/function-wizard.png" rel="lightbox-2"><img src="latest-updates_files/function-wizard-1024x632.png" alt="" moz-reader-center="true" width="648" height="400"></a></p>
<h2>Conditions apply: Enhanced formatting options in Calc</h2>
<p>Conditional formatting is a powerful feature in Calc. It enables you 
to quickly visualize data in a spreadsheet by setting various useful 
rules on your sheet to adapt the cells formatting, colour, or even add 
icons when certain criteria are met. While a simplified set of 
conditional formats was previously available via an icon in the toolbar,
 you can now also make use of the full dialogs, to be found in the 
Format menu, to define and manage conditions fully.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/conditional-formatting-dialogs.png" rel="lightbox-3"><img src="latest-updates_files/conditional-formatting-dialogs-1024x320.png" alt="" width="648" height="203"></a><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/conditional-formatting-menus.png" rel="lightbox-4"><img src="latest-updates_files/conditional-formatting-menus-1024x632.png" alt="" width="648" height="400"></a></p>
<h2>Better display in Calc: smooth scaling of spreadsheets</h2>
<p>The scaling of spreadsheets has been significantly improved in CODE 
4.2.0. While in Calc you could previously only choose between two zoom 
factors of 100% and 200%, now fine adjustment is are possible to suit. 
Using the convenient (and redesigned) quick selector in the lower right 
corner, you can now choose your favourite zoom percentage between 33% 
and 200%.</p>
<h2>More presentation functions in the sidebar</h2>
<p>The new sidebar adds many useful functions to Impress. For shapes and
 outlines, the size, position, colours, transparency, wrapping and so on
 are easy to change.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/impress-sidebar.png" rel="lightbox-5"><img src="latest-updates_files/impress-sidebar-1024x632.png" alt="" moz-reader-center="true" width="648" height="400"></a></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The possibilities to alter the slide master and lay out,
 from the sidebar, are also completely new in CODE 4.2. You can now 
access extensive layout functionality for slides such selecting masters,
 layouts and even editing your own master pages. Needless to say, that 
character settings, fonts types, sizes, colours and spacing can also be 
easily adjusted from the sidebar.</p>
<h2>Handier working with images</h2>
<p>Working with images in all document types is easier, more convenient 
and more precise. The sidebar allows to adjust colour options, such as 
brightness, contrast or transparency or the red, blue and green portion 
of the image. Another handy feature is the adjustment of the layer 
settings of the images. Bring them to the foreground or arrange them in 
the background – all via the sidebar.</p>
<h2>Rich copy and paste between docx and xlsx documents and more… in the browser</h2>
<p>People that work online, often have many documents open 
simultaneously, and want to mash them together into bigger, better 
documents. So you’ll be glad to learn the CODE 4.2.0 introduces copying 
of rich formatted content along with images, charts, and other complex 
elements, between your online spreadsheets, documents and presentations.</p>
<h2>New online colour picker</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">For certain elements there is not only the usual colour 
selector, offering a palette, but also the colour picker to chose any 
custom colours needed. Use it with text and background in presentations,
 lines in spreadsheets and presentations, text and background for 
floating frames in text documents.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/color-palette.png" rel="lightbox-6"><img src="latest-updates_files/color-palette-1024x632.png" alt="" moz-reader-center="true" width="648" height="400"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/color-picker.png" rel="lightbox-7"><img src="latest-updates_files/color-picker-1024x632.png" alt="" moz-reader-center="true" width="648" height="400"></a></p>
<h2>Handling links in Writer has just become more pleasant</h2>
<p>CODE 4.2.0 brings very nice enhancements when working with 
hyperlinks. Whenever the mouse cursor is located next to a link or on 
it, you will be kindly&nbsp; notified by a pop-up dialogue allowing the 
real target to be inspected and launched conveniently with a single 
click.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/writer-inspect-hyperlinks.gif" rel="lightbox-8"><img src="latest-updates_files/hyperlink-click-to-animate.png" alt="" width="300"></a></p>
<h2>Beautiful new icons and a redesigned theme</h2>
<p>The new design of the icons embellishes the upper toolbar. The new 
theme is tidier has more generous spacing, and is clearer in general. It
 should increase productivity and reduce friction. Buttons that are 
selected have a clearer and more distinct highlight too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CODE-Toolbar-up.png" rel="lightbox-9"><img src="latest-updates_files/CODE-Toolbar-up.png" alt="" moz-reader-full-width="true" moz-reader-center="true"></a></p>
<p>The status bar also benefits from our visual redesign. Not only does 
it look cleaner, it also improves quick access to the functions located 
there. The language of documents can now also be set via a popup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CODE-toolbar-down.png" rel="lightbox-10"><img src="latest-updates_files/CODE-toolbar-down.png" alt="" moz-reader-full-width="true" moz-reader-center="true"></a></p>
<h2>Table editing in the side bar and table handles</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">In Writer it is now possible to manipulate tables 
extensively from the sidebar and we also added easy to use in-document 
selection handles, choose either or both. Previously the table dialog 
had to be used, which was far less convenient. These handles make 
adjusting row height and column width very user-friendly.</p>
<p lang="en-GB"><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CODE420_WriterTable_SideBar-2-1.png" rel="lightbox-11"><img src="latest-updates_files/CODE420_WriterTable_SideBar-2-1.png" alt="" width="831" height="474"></a></p>
<p lang="en-GB">You want to insert rows or columns from here? Of course!
 Or delete some or all of them? a click! Furthermore, the sidebar also 
allows you to set the background colour of the cells or to fine-tune 
their height and width of rows and columns. It becomes even more 
interesting if you select several cells. Then you can also merge them 
from the sidebar or distribute them evenly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/writer-table-options.png" rel="lightbox-12"><img src="latest-updates_files/writer-table-options-1024x632.png" alt="" moz-reader-center="true" width="648" height="400"></a></p>

<h2>Table of contents</h2>
<p>In text documents, the full table of contents can now be configured 
with the new dialogs. So even online, you can customize your complex 
table of contents in a few clicks according to your wishes. For example 
edit the entries and change style, background or columns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Snapshot_42_ToC_Dlgdoc.png" rel="lightbox-13"><img src="latest-updates_files/Snapshot_42_ToC_Dlgdoc-1024x599.png" alt="" moz-reader-center="true" width="648" height="379"></a></p>
