      "message": "Just reading through - if we skip removing the session at this point - since we\u0027re auto-saving or whatever: do we really come back and remove it later ?\n\nI\u0027m not so convinced. I would like to tag such sessions as needing removal - and have a cleanup phase in the main polling loop that removes them as/when the save is done (I guess). What if we remove two or more sessions in the same loop here ? - could be more robust.\n\nStill its no worse than before -\u003e merge.",
