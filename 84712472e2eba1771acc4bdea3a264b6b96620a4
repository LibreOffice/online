      "message": "I\u0027m not totally convinced that we need another sub-class here of the StreamSocket, and another sub-class of the WebSocketHandler. Perhaps it\u0027s not a purists approach - but a \u0027void sendFD(int fd);\u0027 and \u0027int receiveFD();\u0027 method pair, that grabs out the file-descriptor from the underlying Socket - and of course fails with an error (as the underlying OS primitives will) when it\u0027s not a UDS would be easier to read \u0026 keep our classes easier to understand I hope.\n\nPerhaps those two methods could live in \u0027Socket\u0027 or \u0027StreamSocket\u0027 itself. They\u0027re not generally useful things we want people to use a lot for sure \u003d)",
