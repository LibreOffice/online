It doesn\u0027t even mention professional support, and is quite technical.\n\nSure it would be better to have a dedicated page later, but for now I think our support page is fine, as users can see whom they can contact for professional support.\n\nAnyway, now we have a dedicated hub link for this and can change it afterwards.",
