LibreOffice Online API
=======================

Document conversion:
    - API: HTTP POST to /lool/convert-to
        - parameters: format=<format> (see e.g. "png", "pdf" or "txt"), and the file itself in the payload
    - example: curl -F "data=@test.txt" -F "format=pdf" https://localhost:9980/lool/convert-to

WOPI Extensions
===============

LibreOffice Online uses WOPI protocol to interact with hosts who wants to
integrate LibreOffice Online in them.

Refer to WOPI docs[https://wopi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/] for detailed
information. This documentation only mentions extensions to upstream WOPI protocol,
WOPI extensions, that are implemented by LibreOffice Online backend in addition to
upstream WOPI protocol.

(Please note that upstream WOPI implementation is also not 100% complete)
