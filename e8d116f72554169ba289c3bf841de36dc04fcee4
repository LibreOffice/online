      "message": "I would like this piece taken care of before we re-enable this. ie. reading the whole directory hierarchy that we are able to serve, and also compressing it ahead of time (on startup) would be by far the best. There is a punitive cost of doing the compression when file serving: it makes LOOLWSD significantly slower I\u0027m afraid.",
