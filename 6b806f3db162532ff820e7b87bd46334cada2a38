Please can you check that whatever calls this metod is also happy and that the authorization process genuinely does fail cleanly in this case - do we need to throw an exception instead or something ?\n\nCan you separate this commit from the other change to the HTML - I\u0027m less convinced on the HTML-side \u003d) and it\u0027s a separate piece.\n\nOtherwise good stuff.\n\nThanks !",
