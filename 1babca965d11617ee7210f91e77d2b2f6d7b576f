      "message": "I guess you mean LOOLWSD.cpp, and not FileServer.cpp. I think the reason to set it only for pdf files is because most browsers have inbuilt pdf viewing support but not inbuilt odf/ooxml viewing support. Setting Content-Disposition instructs the browsers to just download the file and not use their plugins to view the file which is what we want for pdfs. Since they can\u0027t view odf/ooxml anyway, Content-Disposition is not needed for others.\n\nAnd I just Diff-ed this patch with \u0027Base\u0027 in gerrit and it doesn\u0027t remove that special handling of pdf files in getContentTypes, however it does show it removed when I diff-ed with patch set 1. It seems there are two or more commits on your local and you didn\u0027t squash them with same Change-Id before uploading this patch ?",
