      "message": "Why do we need to check for isDocumentOwner? Previously, we did that because we always fell back on document owner, if no writable session exists. But if the idea of this patch is to never return a read-only session, then we don\u0027t care which one is the document owner, since we will not return anything if there are no writable sessions.",

Why can\u0027t we just use the first writable session?\n\nNote that previously we returned the document owner because that was the fall-back. We assumed the document owner is the \"default\" session. But it seems this is changed now and we only care about writable (unless I\u0027m missing something).",
