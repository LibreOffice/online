      "message": "The comment in _onReplyClick function says that assigning null to such elements is problematic in \u0027some\u0027 browsers. I think by \u0027some\u0027, it means IE, Edge etc. If that is true, then this patch will be convert it to \u0027null\u0027 (string type) which when checked in _onLostFocusReply method will pass the condition : \"if (this._nodeReplyText.value !\u003d\u003d \u0027\u0027) {\" leading to a reply comment with a \u0027null\u0027 string even after one hits cancel.\n\nThe ideal solution, hence, it seems, is to do :\nthis._nodeReplyText.value \u003d \u0027\u0027;",
